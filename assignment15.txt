* learn the Document Object Model (DOM):

1. from javascript.info (Part 2): sections [1.1 - 1.8].

* write JS code to transform the HTML file as illustrated in before.png and after.png.
1. add a file called script.js to the "assignment14-code" folder and link it to the HTML file via a <script> tag.
2. do not modify the HTML or CSS. everything must be done in JS only.
3. push the "assignment14-code" folder only to github.
